   successfully built, the result pointer will be changed to point to
   a dynamically allocated copy and return true. Return false if any

   the appropriate character (e.g., \\ in the input becomes \ in the

   the , character, and the null byte '\0' can be used to indicate the end
   of a number. Any other non-digit value should be considered a NON_DIGIT
   and result in a syntax error. If the number was successfully built, it
   should be copied into the location pointed to by the call-by-reference

/* Begins at fsm->current and tries to build a valid JSON object. All JSON
   objects consist of key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the
   value can be either a string or integer. If more than one key-value pair
   is in the object, they are separated by commas. The following examples
   are all valid (note that whitespace is ignored):

     {"a":1}
     { "first": "second", "alpha": "beta"}
     { "integer": 1, "string": "one" }

   These are examples of bad objects (and the corresponding error events):

     { not : "good" }  -- BAD_TOKEN
     { "no \t allowed" : } -- BAD_ID
     { "alpha" } -- NON_COLON
     { "float" : 1.5 } -- BAD_VALUE
     { "a" : "b" : "c" } -- BAD_TOKEN
     { "a" : "b", } -- BAD_TOKEN

   All key-value pairs for an object will be concatenated as a string
   and returned via the keys call-by-reference parameter. The format
   should look exactly as (ignore the leading space):

     KEYS[integer] = 1
     KEYS[string] = one

   AppendKeyValuePair should append a new line (ending in '\n') for
   each key-value pair found. In the case above, the exact string
   returned would be:

     "KEYS[integer] = 1\nKEYS[string] = one\n"

   Return true if the object is successfully parsed, false otherwise.
